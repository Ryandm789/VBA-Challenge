Overview of Project:
The purpose of this stock analysis is helping client obtain and compare Total Daily Volume and Yearly Return of each target stock in particular year. Designing a VBA Macro for applying to different years, client can observe and make conclusion which stock performs better than others specifically in green energy industry. Applying Macro reduce the possibility of human error for repetitive calculator tasks. Additionally, clients can apply Macro in multiple sheets for multiple stocks simultaneously. Refactor project to create one outer loop and three nested loops in order to loop through the stock original data only once and collect all information in a single pass.

Results:
According to the data 2018, only ENPH and RUN two stocks had positive yearly Return as well as large Total Daily Volume. Both of them was outperformance than others green stocks. *(Review Image)
